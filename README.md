# About The Project
A website 
that allows users to see weekly schedule of a 
classes. Thus, users can see the weekly 
schedule of the class they want to find by 
selecting the class. If users enter time and 
day, system will automatically list empty 
classes.

With this website, both users (for example 
students) and admin can access and see 
weekly schedule of the classes. There is no 
need to log in for users but admin needs to 
log in to edit classes.
